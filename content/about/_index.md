## Hello 👋🏽 

I am currently a System administrator and a certified Azure cloud admin. I'm part of an enterprise on-prem cloud infrastructure team at my job, working mostly with vmware and containers in a Kubernetes environment.

On the side, I do software devlopment, which I'm constantly learning and planning on documenting in [my blog](https://blog.hellodun.com).
