## Hi 👋🏽 

I'm ```Duncan```, a System administrator and certified Azure cloud admin. I'm part of an on-prem enterprise cloud infrastructure team at work, where I mostly work with VMware and containers in a Kubernetes environment, among other awesome tech.

On the side, I do software development, which I'm constantly learning and planning on documenting in [my blog](https://blog.hellodun.com).

If you have a short message or question, drop me a message via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncan-gatuthu/).
